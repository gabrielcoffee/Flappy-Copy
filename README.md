# Flappy Copy
A simple Flappy Bird remake built entirely with Java. It keeps the original gameplay but adds a few twists:

Difficulty Levels: Pick how hard you want the game to be.
Heart System: Start with a few lives, so one mistake wonâ€™t end your run.

To play just download the codebase and run the file on the "releases" folder.

Some screenshots of the game:
